# Aspiration Execution Gap Progress

## Objective

Close the aspiration execution gap and rapidly reach a fully functional platform that reliably finds opportunities and creates winning responses to them. The target state includes working opportunity discovery, search/download, scraping, RFP intake, response generation, governance, verification, and deployment readiness.

## Operating Rules

- Keep the full objective intact; do not redefine completion around partial slices.
- Track every concrete slice here.
- Commit and push coherent, verified work regularly.
- Use SearXNG at `https://search.lindela.io` for web search.
- Use Firecrawl at `http://84.247.181.100:3002` for scraping.
- Use the Playwright/headless browser service at `http://84.247.181.100:3003` for pages that require browser/stealth behavior.
- Do not connect app/session/cache traffic to the connectivity-local Redis on `84.247.181.100`; that Redis is for Firecrawl/SearXNG internals only.

## Progress Log

### 2026-05-26 - Discovery Infrastructure Alignment

Status: implemented and verified.

Purpose: make the product's configured search/scraping infrastructure match the available services, so opportunity discovery work starts from the correct live endpoints instead of stale host defaults.

Changes in this slice:
- Point Python SearXNG defaults to `https://search.lindela.io`.
- Point Next.js SearXNG defaults to `https://search.lindela.io`.
- Keep Firecrawl defaults on the connectivity host at `http://84.247.181.100:3002`.
- Move Docling default to the same connectivity host at `http://84.247.181.100:3600`.
- Update infrastructure docs and environment examples to reflect the search/scrape host topology.
- Add config regression tests so SearXNG does not drift back to raw IP/port defaults.

Verification:
- `npm run test -- __tests__/services/searxng-client-config.test.ts` passed.
- `PYTHONPATH=src uv run pytest tests/ci/test_search_infrastructure_config.py tests/ci/test_secrets_manager_docling.py -q` passed.
- `npm run lint -- --max-warnings=0` passed.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- Live SearXNG probe returned JSON search results from `https://search.lindela.io/search?q=rfp&format=json`.
- Live Firecrawl probe successfully scraped `https://example.com` through `http://84.247.181.100:3002/v1/scrape`.

Testing scope note:
- Full-suite tests and production build were intentionally skipped for this slice because the machine is on battery. Prefer focused tests and lightweight checks until power is available or a larger code chunk warrants broader verification.
- `ruff check` on touched Python files is not currently a useful narrow gate: it reports a large set of pre-existing style/docstring/import diagnostics in `src/docfusion/api/dependencies.py`, `src/docfusion/config/secrets.py`, and `src/docfusion/infrastructure/searxng_client.py`.

Remaining after this slice:
- Connect discovery search results to a durable opportunity ingestion workflow where gaps remain.
- Add or strengthen fallback behavior for browser-only sources, including CloakHQ/cloakbrowser only if existing Firecrawl/Playwright paths cannot handle a target source.
- Continue auditing the full opportunity-to-winning-response workflow against the JTBD catalogue.

### 2026-05-26 - SearXNG Opportunity Ingestion

Status: implemented and verified.

Purpose: connect live external search results to durable opportunity records instead of leaving web discovery as a document-only helper.

Changes in this slice:
- Add `discoverAndImportOpportunities`, a server action that searches SearXNG, filters likely opportunity notices, deduplicates by normalized URL fingerprint and source ID, and records an audited import job.
- Support optional Firecrawl enrichment for top search results so high-value runs can store cleaner titles and summaries without making every search import expensive.
- Assign discovered opportunities to the importing user and store provenance metadata including search query, engine, score, normalized URL, and Firecrawl scrape status.
- Persist scraper/discovery identity fields in `createOpportunity` so `source`, `fingerprint`, `portalUrl`, `documentUrl`, and scrape dates are not dropped on new records.
- Add focused tests for SearXNG ingestion, Firecrawl enrichment, duplicate update handling, and unauthenticated access blocking.

Verification:
- `npm run test -- __tests__/actions/discovery-opportunity-import.test.ts __tests__/actions/import-opportunities-auth.test.ts` passed.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passed.

Testing scope note:
- Full frontend suite and production build remain intentionally deferred while on battery. This slice used focused Vitest coverage plus TypeScript checking because the changed surface is a server action boundary.

Remaining after this slice:
- Wire the discovery import action into scheduled/source workflows or an operator UI so target query sets can run without a developer console.
- Add browser-only fallback behavior for pages Firecrawl cannot scrape cleanly, using the existing Playwright service first and CloakHQ/cloakbrowser only if needed.
- Continue auditing the opportunity-to-winning-response workflow against the JTBD catalogue.

### 2026-05-26 - Operator Discovery Run Endpoint

Status: implemented and verified.

Purpose: make live opportunity discovery triggerable through an operational API surface, not only as an internal server action.

Changes in this slice:
- Add `POST /api/opportunities/discovery/run` for scraper-operator/admin controlled discovery runs.
- Validate discovery request fields before any live search work starts.
- Route authorized requests into `discoverAndImportOpportunities` so the same audited import, dedupe, SearXNG, and optional Firecrawl enrichment path is used.
- Add route tests for unauthorized access, malformed request bodies, and successful operator-triggered discovery imports.

Verification:
- `npm run test -- __tests__/api/opportunity-discovery-route.test.ts __tests__/actions/discovery-opportunity-import.test.ts` passed.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed.

Testing scope note:
- Full frontend suite and production build remain intentionally skipped while on battery. This slice used focused route/action tests and TypeScript checking.

Remaining after this slice:
- Add scheduled discovery execution with a service actor or configured assignee, rather than requiring an interactive operator session.
- Add browser-only fallback behavior for pages Firecrawl cannot scrape cleanly, using the existing Playwright service first and CloakHQ/cloakbrowser only if needed.
- Continue auditing the opportunity-to-winning-response workflow against the JTBD catalogue.

### 2026-05-26 - Scheduled Discovery Assignee Path

Status: implemented and verified.

Purpose: let cron/API-key discovery runs persist opportunities under an explicit configured assignee while keeping the interactive server action bound to the authenticated user.

Changes in this slice:
- Move live discovery import execution into a reusable server-side service that accepts an explicit assignee user ID.
- Keep `discoverAndImportOpportunities` authenticated: it still derives the assignee from the current user before calling the service.
- Allow `POST /api/opportunities/discovery/run` to accept `SCRAPER_API_KEY` authorization for scheduled runs when `DISCOVERY_IMPORT_USER_ID` is configured.
- Return a clear `503` configuration error when an API-key discovery run is attempted without `DISCOVERY_IMPORT_USER_ID`.
- Extend route tests to cover session-triggered runs, API-key scheduled runs, missing service assignee configuration, invalid request bodies, and unauthorized access.

Verification:
- `npm run test -- __tests__/actions/discovery-opportunity-import.test.ts __tests__/actions/import-opportunities-auth.test.ts __tests__/api/opportunity-discovery-route.test.ts` passed.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed.

Testing scope note:
- Full frontend suite and production build remain intentionally skipped while on battery. This slice used focused action/route coverage plus TypeScript checking.

Remaining after this slice:
- Add browser-only fallback behavior for pages Firecrawl cannot scrape cleanly, using the existing Playwright service first and CloakHQ/cloakbrowser only if needed.
- Continue auditing the opportunity-to-winning-response workflow against the JTBD catalogue.

### 2026-05-26 - Browser Fallback for Discovery Enrichment

Status: implemented and verified.

Purpose: keep live opportunity ingestion useful when Firecrawl cannot scrape a high-value result cleanly by falling back to the available Playwright/stealth browser service before considering any new browser dependency.

Changes in this slice:
- Add browser fallback enrichment to `executeOpportunityDiscoveryImport` when `scrapeTopResults` is enabled and Firecrawl fails or returns sparse content.
- Default the stealth browser service to `http://84.247.181.100:3003`, while still honoring `STEALTH_SCRAPER_URL`.
- Record whether enrichment came from Firecrawl or browser fallback in discovery metadata, including the fallback reason.
- Expose `browserFallback` and `browserFallbackLimit` through the operator discovery API request parser.
- Align frontend scraper fallback defaults and `.env.example` with the connectivity host Playwright service.
- Add a focused regression test proving a Firecrawl failure is recovered through the browser service and persisted with browser fallback provenance.

Verification:
- `npm run test -- __tests__/actions/discovery-opportunity-import.test.ts __tests__/api/opportunity-discovery-route.test.ts` passed.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed.

Testing scope note:
- Full frontend suite and production build remain intentionally skipped while on battery. This slice used targeted action/route tests and TypeScript checking.

Remaining after this slice:
- Continue auditing the opportunity-to-winning-response workflow against the JTBD catalogue.
- Consider CloakHQ/cloakbrowser only after a real target source fails both Firecrawl and the existing Playwright/stealth service.
