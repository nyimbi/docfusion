# Aspiration Execution Gap Progress

## Objective

Close the aspiration execution gap and rapidly reach a fully functional platform that reliably finds opportunities and creates winning responses to them. The target state includes working opportunity discovery, search/download, scraping, RFP intake, response generation, governance, verification, and deployment readiness.

## Operating Rules

- Keep the full objective intact; do not redefine completion around partial slices.
- Track every concrete slice here.
- Commit and push coherent, verified work regularly.
- Use SearXNG at `https://search.lindela.io` for web search.
- Use Firecrawl at `http://84.247.181.100:3002` for scraping.
- Use the Playwright/headless browser service at `http://84.247.181.100:3003` for pages that require browser/stealth behavior.
- Do not connect app/session/cache traffic to the connectivity-local Redis on `84.247.181.100`; that Redis is for Firecrawl/SearXNG internals only.

## Progress Log

### 2026-05-26 - Discovery Infrastructure Alignment

Status: implemented; ready for commit after lightweight final checks.

Purpose: make the product's configured search/scraping infrastructure match the available services, so opportunity discovery work starts from the correct live endpoints instead of stale host defaults.

Changes in this slice:
- Point Python SearXNG defaults to `https://search.lindela.io`.
- Point Next.js SearXNG defaults to `https://search.lindela.io`.
- Keep Firecrawl defaults on the connectivity host at `http://84.247.181.100:3002`.
- Move Docling default to the same connectivity host at `http://84.247.181.100:3600`.
- Update infrastructure docs and environment examples to reflect the search/scrape host topology.
- Add config regression tests so SearXNG does not drift back to raw IP/port defaults.

Verification:
- `npm run test -- __tests__/services/searxng-client-config.test.ts` passed.
- `PYTHONPATH=src uv run pytest tests/ci/test_search_infrastructure_config.py tests/ci/test_secrets_manager_docling.py -q` passed.
- `npm run lint -- --max-warnings=0` passed.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- Live SearXNG probe returned JSON search results from `https://search.lindela.io/search?q=rfp&format=json`.
- Live Firecrawl probe successfully scraped `https://example.com` through `http://84.247.181.100:3002/v1/scrape`.

Testing scope note:
- Full-suite tests and production build were intentionally skipped for this slice because the machine is on battery. Prefer focused tests and lightweight checks until power is available or a larger code chunk warrants broader verification.
- `ruff check` on touched Python files is not currently a useful narrow gate: it reports a large set of pre-existing style/docstring/import diagnostics in `src/docfusion/api/dependencies.py`, `src/docfusion/config/secrets.py`, and `src/docfusion/infrastructure/searxng_client.py`.

Remaining after this slice:
- Connect discovery search results to a durable opportunity ingestion workflow where gaps remain.
- Add or strengthen fallback behavior for browser-only sources, including CloakHQ/cloakbrowser only if existing Firecrawl/Playwright paths cannot handle a target source.
- Continue auditing the full opportunity-to-winning-response workflow against the JTBD catalogue.
